The Claude Agent SDK enables you to programmatically build AI agents with Claude Code's capabilities. Create autonomous agents that can understand codebases, edit files, run commands, and execute complex workflows.

**Learn more in the [official documentation](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview)**.

## Get started

Install the Claude Agent SDK:

```sh
npm install @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk
```

## Compiled binaries (`bun build --compile`)

When bundling your application into a single executable with `bun build --compile`, the SDK cannot resolve the native CLI binary at runtime — `require.resolve` doesn't work from inside the compiled `$bunfs` (or `B:\~BUN\...` on Windows) virtual filesystem.

Embed the platform-specific binary as a file asset, extract it to a real path, and pass it explicitly:

```js
import binPath from '@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk-darwin-arm64/claude' with { type: 'file' }
import { extractFromBunfs } from '@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk/extract'
import { query } from '@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk'

const cliPath = extractFromBunfs(binPath)

for await (const message of query({
  prompt: '…',
  options: { pathToClaudeCodeExecutable: cliPath },
})) { /* … */ }
```

Each compiled executable embeds one platform's binary, matching your `--target`. Cross-compiling requires installing the non-matching platform package (e.g. `npm install @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk-linux-x64 --force`). On Windows the binary subpath is `/claude.exe` (e.g. `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk-win32-x64/claude.exe`).

## Migrating from the Claude Code SDK
